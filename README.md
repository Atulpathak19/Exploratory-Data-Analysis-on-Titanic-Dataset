# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset
This repository contains a step-by-step Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset widely used in data science for practice and skill-building. The analysis is designed to uncover patterns, relationships, and survival trends among Titanic passengers using Python-based data analysis tools.

The process begins with data acquisition and loading into a Pandas DataFrame, followed by data inspection to check column types, missing values, and overall dataset structure. Data cleaning techniques are applied to address null values, ensure correct data formats, and prepare the dataset for analysis. A statistical overview is then generated, including descriptive statistics for both numerical and categorical features.

The EDA includes:

1.Univariate Analysis: Visualizing single variables such as Age distribution, Fare distribution, Passenger Class counts, and Survival counts.

2.Bivariate Analysis: Comparing survival rates across gender, passenger class, and embarkation points.

3.Multivariate Analysis: Using pair plots and correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between multiple features simultaneously.

4.Visual Storytelling: Employing histograms, count plots, bar charts, pair plots, and heatmaps to present findings clearly and interactively.

Tools & Libraries Used:

1.Python – Core programming language for analysis

2.Pandas – Data manipulation and inspection

3.Matplotlib & Seaborn – Advanced data visualization

4.Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development and documentation

Objectives:

1.Practice real-world EDA workflows in Python

2.Explore and interpret survival patterns among Titanic passengers

3.Build clear and impactful data visualizations

4.Strengthen skills in data cleaning, transformation, and presentation

Key Insights:
1.The notebook reveals how factors like passenger class, gender, and age significantly impacted survival rates. Visual patterns highlight the influence of socio-economic status and demographics on survival probability.

2.This project is an ideal resource for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to understand the complete EDA process—from loading data to generating actionable insights—while building skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
